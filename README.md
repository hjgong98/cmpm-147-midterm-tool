# cmpm-147-midterm-tool

Creates a 2d maze layout of interconnected rooms with randomly generated room type

# Control & Parameters:

- size of maze is controllable
- (tbd) variation of room types is controllable

# Midterm ch

1. A working prototype (improved from Check-In #2) with at least 2 parameters a user could change.
2. At least 20 sample outputs showing variation across different parameter settings.
3. Evidence of parameter tuning (before/after comparisons from Check-in #2, side-by-side outputs, or annotated screenshots).
4. A short expressive range analysis: what kinds of outputs your generator is good at, bad at, or currently cannot produce.
5. A brief note on what you intentionally will NOT support for the midterm tool.
